Description: Tool to crossmount between multiple input and output image files
 xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output
 image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE (Filesystem in
 Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input image. The
 virtual representation can be in raw DD or in VirtualBox's virtual disk file
 format. Input images can be raw DD or EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format).
 In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files
 that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it for example possible to use
 VirtualBox to boot an os contained in a read-only EWF image.
