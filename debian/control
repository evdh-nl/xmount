Description: tool to crossmount between multiple input and output image files
 xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple
 input and output image types. xmount creates a virtual file
 system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a
 virtual representation of the input image. The virtual
 representation can be in raw DD or in VirtualBox's virtual
 disk file format. Input images can be raw DD or EWF (Expert
 Witness Compression Format).  In addition, xmount also
 supports virtual write access to the output files that is
 redirected to a cache file. This makes it for example
 possible to use VirtualBox to boot an OS contained in a
 read-only EWF image.
