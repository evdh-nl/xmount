xmount \- Tool to crossmount between multiple input and output harddisk image files

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B xmount
allows you to convert on\-the\-fly between multiple input and output
harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE
(Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input
image. The virtual representation can be in raw DD, in VirtualBox's virtual
disk file format or in VmWare's VMDK format. Input images can be raw DD or EWF
(Expert Witness Compression Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports
virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file.
This makes it for example possible to use VirtualBox to boot an os contained
in a read\-only EWF image.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.B 
fopts: (Options specific to FUSE)
  \-d: Enable FUSE's and xmount's debug mode.
  \-h: Display this help message.
  \-s: Run single threaded.
  \-o no_allow_other: Disable automatic addition of FUSE's allow_other option.
  \-o <fmopts> :
    Specify fuse mount options. Will also disable automatic addition of FUSE's
    allow_other option!
  INFO: For VMDK emulation, you have to uncomment "user_allow_other" in
        /etc/fuse.conf or run xmount as root.

.B 
mopts: (Options specific to xmount)
  \-\-cache <file> :
    Enable virtual write support and set cachefile to use.
  \-\-in <type> :
    Specify input image type. Type can be "dd" or "ewf".
  \-\-info :
    Print out some infos about used compiler and libraries.
  \-\-out <type> :
    Specify output image type. Type can be "dd", "vdi", "vmdk(s)".
  \-\-owcache <file> :
    Same as \-\-cache <file> but overwrites existing cache.
  \-\-rw <cache_file> :
    Same as \-\-cache.
  \-\-version :
    Same as \-\-info.
  INFO: Input and output image type defaults to "dd" if not specified.
.br 
.B 
ifile:
  Input image file. If you use EWF files, you have to specify all image
  segments! (If your shell supports it, you can use .E?? as file
  extension to specify them files)
.br 
.B 
mntp:
  Mount point where virtual files should be located.

.SH "BUGS"
Hopefully none. If you find any, please e\-mail to <bugs@pinguin.lu>.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
To xmount an EWF image from your acquired disk as a raw DD image under /mnt,
use the following command:

  xmount \-\-in ewf ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

To xmount the same ewf image as vdi file, you would use a command like this:

  xmount \-\-in ewf \-\-out vdi ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

And to enable virtual write support on a raw DD input image xmounted as VDI
file:

  xmount \-\-out vdi --cache ./acquired_disk.cache ./acquired_disk.dd /mnt
